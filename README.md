# My process

--> Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



What I learned

The most important thing  I learnt while creating the Project was about the Responsive website designed using CSS. Lots of trial and errors took place and tried creating the layout as per the given design as much closer as possible .
Implementation  of Flexbox and z-index in CSS really helped me to go in depth of those concepts while application .

I could not say that I was really satisfied with my work but need to go way too long  to mastery all these concepts only through practising and implementing the concepts.

Continued development

In future projects, I am interested in figuring out ways to use less code to get to the end product as well as becoming more comfortable with flexbox and grid in CSS so that I don't run into as many issues getting a Rresponsive websites.
